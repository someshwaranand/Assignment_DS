    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "    - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is popular because it is easy to learn, versatile, large and active community, large number of libraries and frameworks, efficient, reliable, and fast.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "   - An interpreter in python is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "    - Pre-defined keywords are predefined words that hold a special meaning and have specific purpose in python.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "    - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
    "    - In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to change after it has been created.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "    - Lists are mutable because they are designed to be flexible and allow for efficient modifications. Tuples are immutable because they are designed to be efficient and secure for data that should not be changed after creation\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "    - == (Equality operator) compares the values of two objects and returns True if the values of the objects are equal, otherwise it returns False. is(Identity operator) compares the memory addresses of two objects and returns True if both variables refer to the same object in memory, otherwise it returns False.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "    - Logical operators are used to combine and evaluate multiple conditions, resulting in a single Boolean value(True or False). Three main logical operators are 'and', 'or', 'not'.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "    - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing the data type of a variable from one to another.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "    - Implicit Type Casting(Automatic Type Conversion): Python automatically converts one data type to another without explicit instruction from the programmer. Typically it occurs when performing operations that involve different data types. Python tries to find a compatible type for the operation to proceed. Explicit Type Casting(Manual Type Conversion): The programmer explicitly instructs Python to convert a value from one data type to another using built-in functions. \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "    - Conditional statements in Python are used for controlling the flow of your program's execution. They allow us to make decisions within our code, executing specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
    "    - The elif statement in Python is used to check for multiple conditions sequentially. It's short for \"else if.\"\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "    - for Loop is primarily used to iterate over a sequence of elements (like lists, tuples, strings, etc.) or a range of numbers. while Loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition remains True.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I am writing a game where a player controls a character that needs to collect a certain number of coins to win. I don't know beforehand how many moves the player will make or how many coins they'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why a while loop is more suitable here:\n",
    "    Unknown Number of Iterations: The game's duration is unpredictable. The player might collect all coins quickly, or it might take many moves. A while loop allows the game to continue as long as the player hasn't collected the required number of coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dynamic Condition: The loop's termination depends on the player's actions and the game's state (number of coins collected). This dynamic condition is well-suited for a while loop.\n",
    "\n"
